Watchlist
=========

Uses `wishlist <https://github.com/Jaymon/wishlist>`__ to monitor an
Amazon wishlist and send an email when prices change.

Installation
------------

Install:

::

    $ pip install watchlist

Or be bleeding edge:

::

    $ pip install "git+https://github.com/Jaymon/watchlist#egg=wishlist"

You'll need to setup a `Sendgrid <https://sendgrid.com/>`__ account (if
you don't have one already, there is a free tier).

And you'll need some environment variables:

::

    export SENDGRID_KEY=YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY
    export BROWSER_CACHE_DIR=/var/watchlist
    export PROM_DSN_1="prom.interface.sqlite.SQLite://${BROWSER_CACHE_DIR}/watchlist.db#watchlist"

Make sure your ``BROWSER_CACHE_DIR`` actually exists.

Install `wishlist's dependencies
also <https://github.com/Jaymon/wishlist#dependencies>`__.

If you have a private wishlist, then you'll need to login to Amazon
before you can run watchlist, you can follow the `wishlist
directions <https://github.com/Jaymon/wishlist#1-minute-gettings-started>`__
to signin.

Then you can run this:

::

    $ watchlist NAME

Where ``NAME`` is the Wishlist name, basically the string in the url
``https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/NAME``. You can set this
command up in a cron job to have it run periodically and send you
updates.
